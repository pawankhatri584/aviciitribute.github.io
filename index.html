                            After achieving widespread commercial success, Bergling began working with his manager and executive producer Ash Pournouri to start House for Hunger in 2011, a charity dedicated to alleviating global hunger. The pair wanted to showcase the giving spirit fostered by the house music community. Bergling explained, "You have to give something back.<br><br> In 2016, Bergling's health deteriorated, and he retired from performing live. In the 2017 documentary Avicii: True Stories, directed by his close and longtime collaborator Levan Tsikurishvili, Bergling spoke about his physical and mental health struggles. The documentary depicts the pressure from his management to continue performing live in spite of his objections.
    
                            There was high pressure from management and fans to continue touring and maintaining his public persona. Bergling feared upsetting fans. He was sensitive to the 'flood of hate mail' after cancelled gigs.
